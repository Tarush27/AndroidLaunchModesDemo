# AndroidLaunchModesDemo
This android app lets us know about how activities get launched and while launching them
why launch modes are so important as this concept also relates back stack and tasks conecpt
for an activity which is only the building block of an android app.

This also improves our understanding about keeping the activities in back stack or not.
We have the following launch modes:
-> singleTop
-> singleTask
-> singleInstance
-> standard
